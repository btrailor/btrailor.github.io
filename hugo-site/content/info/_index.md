## About

Brett Gershon is a sound artist, instrument builder, and developer based in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Working at the intersection of code, electronics, and sound, Brett creates tools and compositions that explore the musical potential of errors, accidents, and emergent systems.

## This Site

There are many things I do and many others I want to do. Coding, making music, designing systems, writing about process, building instruments, communicating ideas. Some things I've done remain undocumented. Some things I want to do exist only as unrealized potential.

This site serves two purposes:

1. **To give shape to ideas before they have been realized** — sketches, concepts, and works-in-progress given form through documentation
2. **To become an archive** — a record of completed work, released into the world

Being _under development_ is the goal. Not a disclaimer, but a philosophy. The site itself is a system of organization—a practice for sustaining polymathic interest across domains that refuse to stay separate.

## Current Projects

- **Two Tangles** — Dual shift register instrument for Norns/Grid
- **Elder Futhark Icon Set** — Commercial runic icon library
- **BEES Development** — Continuing the Aleph visual patching environment
- **POSE System** — Publish Once, Syndicate Everywhere content pipeline
- **Learning Programs** — 26-week curricula for creative coding mastery

## Available for Freelance Work

I'm currently accepting freelance projects and collaborations in the following areas:

**Sound & Music** — Custom audio for video games, interactive media, films, and installations. Specializing in generative systems, modular synthesis, and exploring the musical potential of glitches and errors.

**Web Design & Development** — Artist portfolios, musician websites, and creative projects built with modern frameworks. Clean, minimal aesthetics with an emphasis on user experience and performance.

**Brand Identity & Design** — Visual identity systems for musicians, record labels, cultural organizations, and creative practitioners. Album artwork, promotional materials, and cohesive brand guidelines.
