A hybrid analog-digital workflow built around the philosophy of continuation over completion.

## The Flow

1. **Morning** — Obsidian generates briefing PDFs exported to Supernote via NAS WebDAV
2. **Daytime** — Portable reference and annotation on e-ink
3. **Evening** — Processing notes back into Obsidian knowledge graph

## Obsidian Plugins

- **Calendar** — Visual timeline navigation
- **Templater** — Dynamic template generation
- **Dataview** — Query-based dashboards
- **Periodic Notes** — Daily, weekly, quarterly structure

## Mental Models

- Finite vs Infinite Games (continuation focus)
- Reverse Engineering (outcomes → process → resources)
- Systems Theory (emergence, feedback loops, boundaries)
- Explore vs Exploit decision-making

## Templates

Structured templates for daily notes, weekly reviews, and project management following a consistent grammar across all note types.
