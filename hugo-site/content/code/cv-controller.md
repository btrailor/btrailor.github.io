In the spirit of the old Audacity image glitching technique, I've dveloped a Maxforlive device that allows for the implementation of image to audio to image conversion. This device allows for powerful image processing using the whole host of abelton live's tools.

**Specifications:**

Two-Device System built with Max and Java Script

1. **Input Device**

   - Loads BMP images
   - Converts pixel data to audio samples
   - Exports as WAV files for offline processing
   - JavaScript:

2. **Output Device**
   - Loads processed audio (JSON or WAV)
   - Converts audio samples back to pixels
   - Reconstructs BMP images
