Dual shift register synthesis and sequencing instrument for Norns, inspired by the Lorre Mill Double Knot. Two independent 8-stage shift registers interact through a flexible routing matrix with 13 logic operations, creating evolving generative patterns.

**Features:**
- Dual voice FM synthesis with Moog-style filters
- 13 logic operations (AND, OR, XOR, ADD, etc.)
- Grid 128 controller support
- 4 independent LFOs with modulation matrix
- MIDI clock sync with swing
