Continuing development of BEES, the visual patching environment for the monome Aleph.

## Goals

- Move from 0.8.x community release toward 1.0
- **Bonus:** Port monome Teletype to Aleph platform
- Audio effects processing system improvements
- beekeep desktop editor M1 Mac support

## Aleph as Performance Mixer

Custom BEES application with Grid 128 control surface:

- Scene management and recall
- Routing matrix visualization
- LED feedback for signal flow
- Visual patching interface

Alternative to hardware mixer limitations—software flexibility with tactile control.

## Timeline

8-9 month development arc, working alongside other projects.
